  <h1>Polygons</h1>
  <p>You can draw polygons which are closed shapes instead of using just lines. This is much shorter and cleaner, but not needed for all data display</p>

  <svg height="210" width="500">
    <polygon points="200,10 250,190 160,210" style="fill:lime;stroke:purple;stroke-width:1" />
  </svg>

  <h3>NOW YOU TRY - 6</h3>
  <p>Draw a 5 pointed star with a polygon</p>

  <div id="your-star">
    <svg height="210" width="500">
      <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198" style="fill:lime" />
    </svg>
  </div>

  <h3>NOW YOU TRY - 7</h3>
  <p>Draw a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforce">Triforce</a> with three polygons</p>

  <div id="your-triforce">
  </div>

  Also of note is the 'polyline' element, but we don't need that immediately.
